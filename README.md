# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
I decided that I would use react and javascript as well as pure css rather than using css pre-processor like sass just to speed things up, Usually I would use sass or other alternatives so execuse the mess :D.
The project was created from a create-react-app and I use one other dependency to show a loader to the user.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:
```yarn or yarn install to install dependencies```

## Running the application

In the project directory, you can run the following command to start the application:
```yarn start```
